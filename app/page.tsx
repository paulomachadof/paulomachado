          Why I’m a Product Manager

          <p>
            I am a Product Manager driven by the challenge of transforming
            complex problems into simple, valuable user experiences. Since 2017,
            I have worked at the intersection of technology, business, and user
            needs, building digital products across B2B and B2C environments.

          <ul className="list-disc space-y-3 pl-5">
            <li>
              Led product development initiatives in globally distributed teams,
              collaborating across engineering, design, data, and business
              stakeholders.
            </li>
            <li>
              Defined product strategy and roadmaps grounded in user research,
              data analysis, and measurable business outcomes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Drove user-centric decision-making, balancing customer value,
              technical constraints, and organizational goals.
            </li>
            <li>
              Leveraged analytics and experimentation to validate assumptions
              and continuously improve product performance.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            I am particularly motivated by building accessible, scalable
            solutions and turning insights into clear narratives that align
            teams and accelerate execution. With over seven years of experience,
            I consistently deliver products that address real user pain points
            and create measurable impact.
