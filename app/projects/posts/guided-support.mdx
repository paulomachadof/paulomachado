## Summary

As a Senior Product Manager, I led a strategic initiative to reverse critical inefficiency in the chatbot service of a **global technology multinational**. The core challenge was the alarming **84% chat drop-off rate by users before problem resolution**, resulting in an unsustainable overload for human agents and high operational costs.

My approach focused on a deep analysis of the chat flow creation and validation process, culminating in the proposal and implementation of an **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**-based solution. The initial result was a **36% improvement in chatbot performance**, demonstrating the direct impact of data-driven and innovation-focused product management.

| Metric | Before Intervention | After Initial Tests | Impact |
| :--- | ---: | :---: | --- |
| Drop-off Rate (Pre-Resolution) | 84% | ~54% | 36% Reduction |
| Human Agent Overload | High | Moderate | Time Optimization |
| Flow Validation | Intuitive/Manual | AI and Data-Driven | Higher Accuracy |

## The Challenge

The chatbot support service, although designed to scale customer service, was acting as a bottleneck. The high drop-off rate (84%) indicated that users were frustrated with the bot's inability to resolve their issues, forcing them to seek a human agent.

The problem was not solely with the chatbot technology, but fundamentally with the **product management process**. The support and content team dedicated considerable effort to creating and expanding new chat flows, but the definition of which flows to prioritize was based on intuition or immediate demand, rather than a rigorous analysis of historical failure data or user behavior. Furthermore, the validation of these new flows occurred directly in production, without a robust **A/B testing** mechanism, exposing users to suboptimal experiences.

## Discovery & Research Process

To diagnose the root cause of the problem, I initiated a structured discovery process, mapping all phases, interactions, *stakeholders*, and actors involved in the chat journey and content management.

> "The inefficiency was masked by a high volume of work. The team was busy creating, but they were not creating what truly mattered to the user."

The discovery workflow revealed critical flaws in the product lifecycle:

**Key Pain Points Identified:**
1.  **Lack of Demand Validation:** The prioritization of new flows was not validated by historical drop-off or conversion data.
2.  **In-Production Validation:** The absence of an adequate *testing* environment led to flow validation directly in the customer environment, negatively impacting the experience.
3.  **User Disconnect:** There was no mechanism to identify the user's profile (e.g., technical, non-technical) and adapt the language or support flow accordingly.

## The Solution

The proposed solution was the introduction of two **Artificial Intelligence Models** and the creation of a **Management Interface** to empower the support team and ensure the human feedback loop in AI training.

### 1. Flow Review and Optimization Model (Flow Optimization AI)
This model was trained on chat history, focusing on:
*   **Gap Identification:** Analyzing where users most frequently dropped off and cross-referencing this with the absence of support flows for those topics.
*   **Improvement Suggestions:** Proposing adjustments to existing flows or the creation of new ones, based on the probability of success (conversion) and the reduction of *handoff* to human agents.

### 2. User Profiling Model (User Profiling AI)
This model analyzes the user's first message to determine their profile (e.g., *techno-knowledgeable*, *non-technical*, *frustrated*).
*   **Dynamic Redirection:** The chatbot immediately adapts the language, the depth of questions, and the support flow, increasing relevance and the chance of resolution.

The mind map below summarizes the problems and the implemented solutions:

## Implementation and Iteration

To ensure the adoption and continuous training of the AI models, we developed a dedicated **Web Interface** for human supervisors. This interface was not just a metrics dashboard, but a **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** tool.

**Key Interface Features:**
*   **Metrics Monitoring:** Real-time tracking of completion rate, average chat time, and satisfaction.
*   **Profile Creation:** Ability to create new user profiles (e.g., "Corporate User", "Small Business Owner") and associate them with specific flows.
*   **Manual Training:** Supervisors could review chats where the AI failed in profiling or flow suggestion and manually correct them, feeding the model with high-quality data.

## Results and Next Steps

Initial tests, focused on the highest-volume and highest-drop-off flows, resulted in a **36% improvement in the chatbot completion rate**. This not only freed up human agent capacity for more complex issues but also significantly improved the customer experience.

The next step in the *roadmap* is **integration with the company's CRM tool**. This will allow the import of valuable data such as support history, user device information, and demographic data. Enriching the *dataset* with this external information will enable more sophisticated training of the AI models, refining user profiling and the accuracy of flow suggestions, aiming for the goal of **reducing the drop-off rate to under 10%**.

This project exemplifies the application of **Senior Product Management** to solve complex business problems, utilizing process analysis, cutting-edge technology (AI), and a product design centered on the human feedback loop.
